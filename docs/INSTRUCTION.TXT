Floruonix Virtual Machine --- DOCUMENTATION
						Flouronix Instruction Set

BREIF
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Like any other virtual machine Flouronix has an instruction
set but rather of it's own. However there is a crucial difference
FVM does not have an instruction "encoding", meaning that operands
and instructions are of the same size i.e. 4 bytes long.
This, of course, introduces a problem, small instructions 
consuming large space, however memory usage for today's computers
is hardly a problem while running runtime VMs. Also, today's PCs
are households of gigabytes of RAM, so we don't think current
generation of computers face any memory shortages.
And now to the point, the reason why FVM uses a "naked"
instruction set is simply to increase efficiency, the CPU 
can quickly resolve operands without the need to decode them.

INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------
V_SLEEP:
	This instruction simply tells the CPU to increment the
	instruction pointer and continue forward with execution.
	NOTES: 
	a) This may also be used by the CPU to skip regions with
	zeroed memory.
LOAD_R(N):
	Loads register N (0-5) with a value or another register.
	NOTES:
	a) Values -257 to -264 WILL be ignored due to an design
	flaw. Use SUBR if you need these values
LOAD_SP:
	Loads register SP with a with of another register or 
	immediate.
LOAD_M:
	Loads operand 1 with the value at address operand 2. 
	NOTES:
	a) Operand 1 MUST be a register
	b) Operand 2 CAN be either a register or a direct value
JMPF, JMPF_E, JMPF_L, JMPF_G:
	Jump to address, jump to if equal, lesser or greater.
	NOTES:
	a) The addresses MUST be 4 bytes aligned.
